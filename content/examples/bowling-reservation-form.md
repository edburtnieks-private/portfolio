## User experience research and discovery

<div>

<div>

### 1. Business

Before doing any research, exploration, design or development work, I wanted to come up with a rough outline for fictional bowling business.

</div>

<div class="themeable">

</div>

</div>

### 2. Proposal research

After I had an idea about the business, I wanted to prepare possible proposal research to address three main questions:

1. How people will find the bowling centre
2. What people will do, see on the site
3. How can I help business (for this specific example I decided to focus on creating online reservation form)

</div>

### 3. Content strategy

#### 3.1. Competitor research

Before moving forward, I wanted to see what is already out there and look at some existing bowling sites in my area. I created separate board for each bowling business, diving and exploring deeper on each one. Then narrowed the list down to most common features I noticed.

#### 3.2. User stories

After I had an idea what already exists, I created user stories to get an idea of possible functionalities to include and prioritize them.

</div>

<div class="themeable">

### 4. Information architecture

At this point I created complete information architecture for whole site. Since I focused only on online reservation form, I will include only that.

I defined possible inputs and outputs for the form.
