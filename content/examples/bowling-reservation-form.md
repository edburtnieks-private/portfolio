## Process

### 1. Coming up with fictional business

Before doing any research, exploration, design or development work, I wanted to come up with a rough outline for fictional bowling business.

### 2. Proposal research

After I had an idea about the business, I wanted to prepare possible proposal research to address three main questions:

1. How people will find the bowling centre
2. What people will do, see on the site
3. How can I help business (for this specific example I decided to focus on creating online reservation form)
